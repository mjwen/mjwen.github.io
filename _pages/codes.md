bondnet
=====
BonDNet is a graph neural network model for the prediction of bond dissociation
energies (BDEs). It can be applied to both homolytic and heterolytic bond
dissociations for molecules of any charge.

KLIFF
=====
A KIM-based Learning-integrated Fitting Framework to train both
physics-motivated and machine learning interatomic potentials.
- [GitHub page](https://github.com/mjwen/kliff)
- [documentation](https://kliff.readthedocs.io)


pair dirp
=========
LAMMPS implementation of the Dihedral-angle-corrected registry-dependent
interlayer potential (DRIP) for multilayer graphene structures.

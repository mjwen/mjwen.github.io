I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics at
University of Minnesota.

I am interested in understanding the mechanics and other physical behaviors of materials
from a microscopic perspective; particularly, the connections between atomic structures
and macroscopic material behaviors.
During my Ph.D., I use mathematical modeling, data analytics, machine learning, and
first-principles and empirical molecular simulations to study 2D materials and
heterostructures (e.g. graphene and MoS2).

A central theme is to create models that describe the interactions between atoms, which
provide the forces governing the atomic motion and deformation.
I have proposed systematic methods and techniques to develop two types of such models:
physics-motivated and machine learning interatomic potentials (IPs, also called force
fields in some areas).
These methods and techniques to create highly accurate IPs are not specific to 2D
materials and heterostructures, but easily transferable for other materials
system.
With such accurate IPs, I believe molecular simulations can become more trustable
so that valuable information can be extracted to understand and design materials and
structures, complementing theory and experiment.

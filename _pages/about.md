I am currently a postdoc scholar working with Prof. Kristin Persson to
study battery materials using machine learning techniques.

I obtained my Ph.D. in *Solid Mechanics* from the University of Minnesota.
Supervised by Prof. Ellad Tadmor, I use mathematical modeling, data analytics,
machine learning, and first-principles and empirical molecular simulations to
study 2D materials and heterostructures (e.g. graphene and MoS2). In particular,
I developed both physics-based and machine learning interatomic potentials for
2D materials.
